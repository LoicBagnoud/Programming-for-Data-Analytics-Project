## 1. Introduction

This project analyses mortality statistics in Ireland using data from the Central Statistics Office (CSO).  
The main goals are:

1. **Data cleaning** – deal with missing values, inconsistent formats, and outliers.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – find trends over time and differences by sex, age group, cause of death, and region (depending on what the dataset provides).  
3. **Correlation analysis** – investigate relationships between mortality rates and other variables.  
4. **Predictive modelling** – build a basic machine learning model to predict mortality rates.

This notebook is intended to demonstrate the full data analysis workflow, from raw CSV to model and conclusions.
